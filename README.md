**Re**al-time Jenkins **Fl**ow St**atus** (Standalone Service)

This tool is used to track the `real-time status` of the Jenkins Build Flow. Admittedly, there is already a plugin named [Build Graph View Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Build+Graph+View+Plugin), which computes a graph of related builds starting from the current one, and renders it as a graph.

However, that plugin is full-fledged with no standalone daemon, which is hard to customized and integrated into your own dashboard.
